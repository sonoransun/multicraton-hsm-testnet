### Phase 12: Release Polish & Publishing Readiness (7 tasks)
Version synchronization, license clarification (Apache-2.0), Cargo.toml metadata, release profile optimization, roadmap documentation, docs updates.

### Phase 13: Actionable Roadmap Items
Audit log export (JSON, NDJSON, syslog RFC 5424), audit chain verification, admin CLI audit commands, macOS CI, code coverage CI (tarpaulin), future work guide. 580+ total tests.

## Current Status

- **126/130 tasks complete** (2 interop tests deferred, 2 Phase 2/3 items deferred)
- **717+ tests** passing
- **v0.9.1** released

## Future Directions

### Near-Term
- **Performance optimization** — narrow the gap vs SoftHSMv2 in RSA
  - *Runtime hot-path (P1–P3: ~40-50% total latency reduction)*
    - [ ] **Eliminate per-operation RSA key re-parsing**: `sign.rs` computes SHA-256 of DER on every sign/verify for cache lookup, then clones the `RsaPrivateKey`. Switch to handle-based `Arc<RsaPrivateKey>` cache keyed on `CK_OBJECT_HANDLE` — eliminates ~1.5-3 µs/op (~15-25%)
    - [ ] **Cache parsed RSA public keys**: `sign.rs` reconstructs `BigUint` modulus + exponent and `RsaPublicKey` on every verify call. Pre-parse at key import/generation, store in `StoredObject` — eliminates ~500-1000 ns/verify (~5-15%)
    - [ ] **Reduce lock acquisitions in C_Sign/C_Verify path**: `functions.rs` takes 4 locks per operation (DashMap session + RwLock session + DashMap object + RwLock object). Use `cached_object` from `C_SignInit` and TLS-cached session `Arc` — eliminates ~100-500 ns/op (~5-10%)
  - *Lock contention & concurrency (P4–P5: ~5-10%)*
    - [ ] **TLS session cache**: Cache `Arc<RwLock<Session>>` in thread-local alongside `CACHED_HSM` to skip DashMap shard lock on every C_* call
    - [ ] **Simplify `get_hsm()` TLS path**: Avoid `Arc::clone` on cache hit; use pinned reference or `RefCell` borrow
  - *Allocation reduction (P6: ~3-5%)*
    - [ ] **Stack-allocate signature buffers**: ECDSA/Ed25519 signatures fit in ≤144 bytes; use `ArrayVec<u8, 512>` instead of heap `Vec<u8>` in sign functions
    - [ ] **Pass output buffer from C ABI to backend**: PKCS#11 callers already provide output buffers; thread them through to crypto backend to eliminate intermediate allocations
  - *Build & CI*
    - [x] **CI test split**: Parallel-safe crypto tests (92 tests, `--test-threads=8`) vs serial PKCS#11 ABI tests (625 tests, `--test-threads=1`)
    - [ ] **`cargo-nextest` evaluation**: Per-process test isolation would eliminate `--test-threads=1` requirement entirely
    - [ ] **`[profile.test] opt-level = 1`**: Faster crypto-heavy test execution
- **Stable PQC crates**: Upgrade ml-kem, ml-dsa, slh-dsa from RC to stable when released
- **Unified rand_core**: Consolidate dual rand_core versions (0.6 + 0.10) when PQC ecosystem unifies

### Medium-Term
- **FIPS 140-3 certification**: Submit for CMVP validation with aws-lc-rs FIPS backend
- **HSM clustering**: Multi-node key replication for high availability
- **KMIP support**: Key Management Interoperability Protocol alongside PKCS#11

### Long-Term
- **Hardware acceleration**: Intel QAT, ARM CryptoCell integration
- **Cloud KMS bridge**: AWS KMS, Azure Key Vault, GCP Cloud KMS as backing stores
- **PKCS#11 v3.1**: Track and implement spec updates as published
- **Formal verification**: Model checking of critical state machines
